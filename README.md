my first ML project. trying to predict bitcoin every 5 mins. Different models included. bad data set though and im collecting it every 5 mins. wish i had a live set, also more data besides just btc price. ensemble methods would be benificial. 

working on:
-batch data
-L2 regularization
-hyperparameter tuning
-visualization
-GUI
